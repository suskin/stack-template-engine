// A ResourceEngineRunner is responsible for creating resources for a template stack when a hook is executed.
//
// The inputs are:
// - A hook configuration
// - The object which triggered this hook
// - The source files to create resources from
//
// The outputs should be:
// - Created resources
//
// This interface is still fairly new; in the future we'll want to be able to represent the status of the resources
// which are being created. For example, if the resources are created asynchronously (say by running a Job), the
// output the first time the engine is run may be the status of the Job. The next time, if the job is finished, it may
// be some sort of reference to the objects which have been created.
